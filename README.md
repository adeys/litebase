# Litebase is a lightweight Firebase inspired Real Time Database.

Litebase - Lightweight real time database

## Litebase modules

- @litebase/server - Backend.
- @litebase/client - Frontend.

Litebase was created as a lightweight self-hosted real time and offline-first database to power small to medium apps during development and test stages.

It was inspired by the Firebase Real Time and Cloud Firestore API, thus it doesn't want neither to replace nor reproduce all of its functions.
Litebase first purpose is to provide small-sized RT Database while being efficient.

## Contributions
Any contribution is welcome. As for now there's not yet tests to provide consistency in the code but I'm still working on it.
Feel free to contact me [K. Raphael](mailto:raphknight1@gmail.com) or to open issues if you have any ideas.
Thanks.
